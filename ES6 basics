//let is like var but shows error when overwritten and doesnt change when is globala nd local with same name

//const is a read only variable that cant be changed. common practice: use ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES_BETWEEN_WORDS to name const variables. 
However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. 
Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

function printManyTimes(str) {
  const SENTENCE=str + " is cool!";
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i+=2) {
    console.log(SENTENCE);
  }
}



//mutate an array declared with const
const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
s[0]=2;
s[1]=5;
s[2]=7;
  // Using s = [2, 5, 7] would be invalid
}

//prevent object mutation with object freeze
const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
    PI: 3.14
  };
Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

  try {
    MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
  } catch(ex) {
    console.log(ex);
  }
  return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();
